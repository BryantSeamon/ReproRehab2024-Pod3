Three things:
1) [Git for Humans](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans)! by Alice Bartlett. This is my absolute favorite slide deck meant to give you an intuitive understanding of what Git does and Git-related lingo. This introduction to the logical structure and function of Git will help you identify potential uses in your research work.

2) [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): If #1 made you curious and you want to explore more, the website linked will take you through installation.

3) GitHub: GitHub is the user-friendly platform that uses the Git software to do all the things you can do with Git but in a less overwhelming way! (think R studio for R... similar concept). GitHub can be used as a desktop application or directly off the website. To get started, [sign up for an account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)

4) Using Git within R Studio: (thanks to our Guru Andrew!) [Very useful website](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone#fork-configure-upstream) on using Git within R.
