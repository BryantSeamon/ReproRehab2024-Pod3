Each week, we will share with you a **"codebook"** that contains the code and description for what we covered in class. This codebook will be shared in 3 formats to ensure it is accessible to everyone:

1) [.IPYNB](https://github.com/rinivarg/ReproRehab2024-Pod3/blob/main/Materials/Week%201/Week%201%20-%20Codebook.ipynb) -- this is a Jupyter Notebook. It contains the most comprehensive format with commented code and markdown descriptions of what each line does. It also is executable! (more on this later)
2) [.PDF format](https://github.com/rinivarg/ReproRehab2024-Pod3/blob/main/Materials/Week%201/Week%201%20-%20Codebook.pdf) -- this plain old PDF is just as comprehensive but not executable format for your reference
3) [.R format](https://github.com/rinivarg/ReproRehab2024-Pod3/blob/main/Materials/Week%201/Week%201%20-%20Codebook.r) -- this is R code. It is the least comprehensive codebook with only a commented version of the code, but essentially will run on your R studio interface and do all the exact same things.
